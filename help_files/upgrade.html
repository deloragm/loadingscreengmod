            I've tried to make upgrading as easy as possible, below are guides on how to upgrade your specific version of FlatLoad
            </p>

      	</div>
        
        <div class="box-wrap">
           	<h2>UPGRADE FROM V1.4 TO V1.5</h2>
            
            <p class="text-box"><!-- PAGE TEXT -->
            Upgrading your version of FlatLoad 1.4 to 1.5 is very easy but if you don't want the hassle with upgrading then you can just use the already upgrade
            versions in this download and just reconfigure it with the same settings you used previously. To upgrade your old version all you will need to do is 
            edit index.php and style.css<br /><br />
            
            1. EDIT CODE IN STYLE.CSS<br />
            1.5 fixes a weird rendering issue with the border on the avatar so you will need to open up style.css and look for the code below.</p>
            <pre>#avatarimg {border: 2px solid #FFFFFF; border-radius: 50%; width: 170px; height: 170px; 
float: left; margin: 15px 0 0 30px;}</pre>
            <p>and replace it with the code below.</p>
            <pre>#avatarimg {border-radius: 85px; -moz-border-radius: 85px; -webkit-border-radius: 85px; 
overflow: hidden; width: 170px; height: 170px; float: left; margin: 15px 0 0 30px; 
border: 2px solid #FFFFFF;}

#avatarimg img {width: 170px; height: 170px;}</pre>

			
			<p>
			2. EDIT INDEX.PHP
			You now need to open up index.php and look for the code below.</p>
            
            <pre>echo "&lt;img id=\"avatarimg\" src=\"" . $table["avatarfull"] . "\" /&gt;";</pre>
                      
			<p>and replace it with the code below:</p>
            
            <pre>echo "&lt;div id=\"avatarimg\"&gt;";
echo "&lt;img src=\"" . $table["avatarfull"] . "\" /&gt;";
echo "&lt;/div&gt;";</pre>


<p>3. YOUR DONE<br />
That's it!, we're all done, if something has gone wrong then it's probably easier to do a new installation.</p>
    </div>
        
        <div class="box-wrap">
           	<h2>UPGRADE FROM V1.3 TO V1.4</h2>
            
            <p class="text-box"><!-- PAGE TEXT -->
            Upgrading your version of FlatLoad 1.3 to 1.4 is very easy but if you don't want to hassle with upgrading then you can download
            1.4 and just reconfigure it with the same settings you used previously.<br /><br />            
            
            1. ADD NEW STYLESHEETS<br />
            In V1.4 there are now two stylesheets in your core loading screen folder, these are style.css and colour.css, these two files define
            how the loading page should look so you need to copy these two new and updated files into your exisiting version.<br /><br />

			2. ADD CODE TO INDEX.PHP
			In V1.4 I have split some of the styling into a new CSS file called colour.css so as to make it easier for you to change the colour of 
            the header bar.<br /><br />
            
            We now need to link up this new stylesheet so we need to load up index.php and look for the little snippet of code below          
            </p>
            
            <pre>&lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt; &lt;!-- Links to the Stylesheet --&gt;</pre>
                      
			<p>and all we need to do is add a little bit of code underneath it, below shows what it should look like.</p>

			<pre>&lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> &lt;!-- Links to the Stylesheet --&gt;
&lt;link href="colour.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;</pre>


<p>3. YOUR DONE<br />
That's it!, that's how easy it is to upgrade your existing installation, you can now take advantage of the multiple coloured backgrounds feature added 
in 1.4<br /><br />

To learn how to take advantage of this new feature just open up the instructions.</p>
